# TicTacToe: [Play](https://vincentz-42.github.io/TicTacToe/)
- Play against your friend on the same computer in a classic game of Tic Tac Toe!

## Objective
- Implement Tic Tac Toe Game with HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- Learn to use Factory Functions and Modules to create a interactive web game with private functions

## Thoughts and Future Functionality
- This was an interest project to start incoporating the use of factory functions and modules. I didn't know that we could lock variables within functions in this way and realize the potential of creating objects this way. Sure I knew about public and private functions, but this allows me to appreciate the lower level workings of the code. As always, the html and css were the most challenging part of this project, and I had to refer to many online resources to get my css and html to properly work. I haven't used objects in this way in javascript, but the concept was not too hard to grasp. 
- Implement Playing Against computer Algorithim for single player capacibility
- Create a scoreboard to track player's win record
- Expand grid to a connect 4 or 5 game.
